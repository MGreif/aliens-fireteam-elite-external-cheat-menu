### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes. I am not responsible for any bans/consequences you might get for using this.
AFE is an amazing game and please use this menu with caution. Do not annoy or disturb other players using this.

### Info
I have not tested the offsets in an online lobby. I only tried them in a self-hosted bot lobby.
This project is also for the sole purpose of me learning CPP, WinAPI and GameHacking in general.
This means, that the CPP code is not perfect and i will try to improve it.

#### Online with other players

If you apply no-spread, it will also affect you in an online session with other players.
The ammo seems to be broken a bit. You can set it to 9999 but after the actual ammo is empty, you will not do any damage to others. You must not reload tho.


## Features

Features labled with [ingame] should only be activated in an active game. If not, it will not crash, but simply not work.
